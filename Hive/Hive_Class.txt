why Hive?
Simple to use
Bult on top of Hadoop
Typical SQL kind of framework
Logic will be converted to map reduce code
Hive read data from HDFS-> Hive convert  SQL into map reduce(intermediate output)->Result.
Map->key, value
Reduce-(sort and shuffle)>Hold all types of values from map output where keys are generating the same value
Metastore-> which will hold the metadata 

Internal table
-> metadata will be maintain by hive
->Actual data will be stored in hive warehouse
External table
->metadata will be maintain by Hive
->Actual data will be at source location.
