NoSQL-Key-value, document, columnar For frequent or heavy analytical queres prefer columnar format or columnar NO-SQL DBs

"In the columnar format what is happening?-> lets say i have written a query "select sum(salary) from  table_1;" My data store in columnar format 
and my disk reader or query engine which i am using its knows what could be the starting memory location for the salary coulmn and it will directly 
point  to the salary memory location and since every values are stored in contigious memory location for the salary column, i just keep on taking 
the summation and my time will not be waisted in order to scan the unnecessary column values"
