Mjor difference between Hadoop1 and Hadoop2
Hadoop1->Major component
Master->Never store any kind of data- Its always try to store metadata. Metadata is data of data. whatever happen in Slave(DN1,DN2, DN3....)always inform to master 
Name Node-(Name node is already aware about in which system i have free space)hold meta information, memory mapping
Job Tracker->It will control the overal execution in cluster, allocate the task depens upon the request from the client, 
      monitor and maintain the task, find out who is going to execute the particular task. 
Combination of name node and job tracker is called as a master.
Task tracker->It always runs on individual machine and control individual processing.
Data Node->It hold the actual data and process it

Primary name node and secondary name node-----------
File system image at t=0 in Primary node
Check pointing->
In secondary name node---Edit file- store all the information starting from 0 to 28s also store previous fs image at time t=0.
Hadoop_2
Introduce YARN(Yet another resource negociator)
Node manager inside of slave
